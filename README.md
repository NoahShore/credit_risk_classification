# credit_risk_classification
The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether this model can be used to accuratly identify high-risk loans. 
- The recall of 91% for high risk loans means that the model correctly identified 91% of the true high risk loan as high risk
- The accuracy of 99% means that it is correctly identifying 99% of the high risk loans and non-high risk loans

I would reccomend that the company use this model as it can predict the high risk loans with great recall. It can also identify low risk loans at a much higher rate.
This will benefit the company in their risk management by mitigating their potential losses on the high risk loans.
